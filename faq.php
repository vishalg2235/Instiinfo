						<div class="q"><span><img src="images/bulb.png" height="18px";></span><div class="ques"><a class="none"><b>What is Insti-Info? What do you provide here?	</b></a></div>					
							<div class="ans">Insti-Info is a website made by four 2nd year students to help their fellow juniors.
							As the name itself suggests, it provides all the necessary info they need about the institute in the 1st year.
							We at instiinfo give them fundaes related to their acads(including notes, lectures, papers, tutorials) as well as general fundaes about the life at IIT.</div></div>
		
					 <div class="q"><span><img src="images/bulb.png" height="18px";></span><div class="ques"><a class="none"><b>	How to download a file from the website?				</b></a></div>
						<div class="ans">On clicking a particular file, the file will not start downloading automatically.
						For downloading a file, you must click on the arrow button.</div></div>
		
					  <div class="q"><span><img src="images/bulb.png" height="18px";></span><div class="ques"><a class="none"><b>	What is the password of chemistry slides?</b></a></div> 
							<div class="ans">It's already written on the page with bold letters "kelvin".</div></div>
					
					 <div class="q"> <span><img src="images/bulb.png" height="18px";></span><div class="ques"><a class="none"><b>	I want to change my department, what is the minimum criteria of cgpa?	</b></a></div> 					
						<div class="ans">First of all for changing the department,the minimum cgpa required officially is 8.50.
						But generally the cut-off cgpa goes around 9.00 due to tough competition.
						Also you must be among top 10% students of your department who are applying for DepC.
						And only 10% students can leave or join the department i.e if the class strength of EE is 60 then only 6 students can leave or join.
						If you are in dual degree course then you can go only to dual degree courses but four year students have an advantage, they have an option to opt.
						For Eg.- If you got a cgpa of 9.7 and you want to go to CS then you must be among the 10% students of your dep., also you must be among those 5 or 6 students who can join the dep. </div></div>

							<div class="ans">Try to maintain a decent cgpa of 8.00 which is fair enough. But atleast you must get a cgpa of 7.5 above.
							If you're able to manage 8.5+ then it would be best.
							Getting good grades depends from person to person. Some students study just before the exam and get good cg.
							It all depends on your time management and concentration.
							But if you start studying 2 weeks before the exam seriously then you can score very good.</div></div>
