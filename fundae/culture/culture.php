			<li><h4>FESTS</h4>
			Now let's talk about the Fests. Like every IIT, IIT-KGP also celebrates two fests.<br /><b>1. SPRING FEST</b> (the annual Social & Cultural Fest)
			<br /><br />Probably the 3 days of <b>SF</b> will be the best time you spend in 1st year of KGP. <b>SF </b>is the annual social & cultural festival organised in month of Jan. & is one of the largest student run college fests in India. The flagship events of SF are - Nukkad, Shuffle, Wildfire, Rangmanch, Centrifuge, Lake Side Dreams, etc. Besides this there is a Perpz stage which is an all day dance floor with a DJ, that attracts huge crowds. The biggest event in Spring Fest is <b>"STAR-NIGHT"</b> which usually involve live concerts by famous Indian artists like<b> Farhan Live, Salim-Sulaiman, Pritam, Kailash Kher, KK, S. P. Balasubramaniam, Shaan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Vishal-Shekhar, Shweta Pandit, Shankar Mahadevan, Shivamani, Sukhwinder Singh</b>. Bands like<i> Pentagram, Swarathma, Underground Authority, Kryptos, Parikrama, Euphoria, Indian Ocean, Strings , Spunk </i> etc. have also been performing here.
			So many participants and audience comes from different colleges to enjoy SF, their arrival is the favourite thing for the boys, you know what I mean :) . One thing that may be I didn't mention is the ratio of girl:boy here is 1:10. And now you definitely know what I mean :P . There is so much excitement and enthusiasm for the fest even before its commencement. Every single person goes out in the streets, they sing, they dance, they eat & they don't sleep. Nights are spent on scholar's avenue, days are busy with all the events going on. Sometimes one is not even able to decide which events should they attend. You better search on Youtube for SF and watch some documentaries then only you'll get some feel of it. I'm already waiting for the next SF to come. <br><a href="http://springfest.in" target="_blank"

		<li><h4>ILLU</h4>
		<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JuHGElbXZjc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
			ILLU is the short form of <b>"ILLUMINATION"</b>. You must have celebrated<b> DIWALI</b> by firing crackers, eating sweets, or maybe never celebrated it. But you could never have imagined that it can be celebrated with a feeling of <b><i>"teamwork"</i></b>! Yes, I'm not kidding you would have never seen anything like this, from weeks before the DIWALI the various halls starts making a huge structure made of 'diyas' which are lit on day of diwali. One by one these diyas are lit and slowly the "structure" starts taking its shape and delivers everyone what people were working so hard for. Even rangolis are made by various halls. I had never seen such amazing rangolis, its like they use <b><i>"technology"</i></b> in making rangolis!!! I can't express in words the essence of diwali, the level of art shown and the tempo people have for it. You will never regret that you didn't get any holidays even on diwali.

		<li><h4>GENERAL CHAMPIONSHIP (GC)</h4>
		<center><a><img src="../pics/cup.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			As the name suggest it is the annual inter hall competition between diff. halls in IIT KGP. It has three different fields : Sports, Technology and So-cult(social & culture). Its the time when ur hall tempo will be at its peak. Each and every boarder of that hall takes part in it whether they will be in team or in cheering team. It is the best time to show your talent and dedication. There are so many diff events under GC. Each event has points. Finally the hall with most points in a category gets the trophy of that GC. If a hall wins all 3 GCs then its called<b> "Platinum GC"</b>.

		<li><h4>BHAAT MAARNA AND 2.2</h4>
		 <center><a><img src="../pics/2.2.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			These two things are integral part of any Kgpian. 2.2 is just a closed loop road which is commonly used for jogging, talking and time passing... And bhaat maarna is the talking people do while sitting, walking, eating etc etc. Even canteens have a item named as "BHAATU MAGGI" in their menu. So u can understand how much influence our lingo has in our life.

		<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXv6zyxMMfI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
			It is a very entertaining treasure hunt type of event organised by 'AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE'. You need a team of 5 to participate in it. There are certain clues out of which different sets of codes are given to different group of teams. Each clue is related to some location in the campus. So your team have to guess the clue nd search for the next one. Top three teams to guess 15 clues are declared winner. So you better start exploring the campus as soon as you arrive here. It will be a memorable event in your life!!!

		<li><h4>LIBRARY</h4>
		<center><a><img src="../pics/lib.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			Hey you must be thinking that library is for studying?? Not in IIT KGP, except for the maggu's !!! Mostly library is used in exam times when its open 24/7 and lots of people stay there whole night long. There are three types of people in library -<br>1. Students who study in groups.<br> 2. Couples-who obviously don't study together.<br> 3. Boys- who come just to have a look at the "crowd".<br> So basically, who only study in the library, are the maggus.
