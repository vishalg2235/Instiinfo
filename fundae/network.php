					<h2>Network Gyan</h2>
					
					<p>
						If you are a Computer Freak then you are certainly lucky to
		get IIT Kgp. Kgp provides you wifi all over the freaking 2100 acre campus. <u>But</u>
		your internet will not work unless you set a proxy in your web 
		browser. The present proxy address is 10.3.100.207 .<br />
		You can set the proxy by following these steps :<br />
		<b>Control Panel > Network n Internet > Internet Options > Connections Tab > LAN Settings > Address(proxy),Port(8080).</b><br><br>
		
		
		
		<h3> <b> Unblocking WhatsApp </b></h3>
		
				
		
		The proxy provided by kgp server <b>BLOCK</b> some websites with inappropriate content and also some mobile apps <b>including Whatsapp.</b>
		<br />Their is a <u>solution</u> to this for android users.
		All you need to do is get an application that provides you a <b>VPN</b>.You can use 
		<br /><b>Droid VPN</b>(easiest to connect but slower speed), 
		<br /><b>SurfEasy</b>(Fastest speed but limited data per month,also takes time to connect) or 
		<br /><b>Psiphon</b>(Moderate speed ,unlimited data, also takes some time to connect)
		<br />And for the computer users what you can do to open the blocked sites is use the "Tor Browser" or use some website that provide you VPN like 'hide my ass' and for more visit this link<br /><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5935863/five-best-vpn-service-providers"target="_blank">Click For More</a><br />
		
		
		
		<br><br><h3><b>DC++</b></h3>
		This proxy also allows you to access the internet via LAN 
		ports provided in your hostel rooms.One thing is certain, 
		you are surely gonna love those ports, reason being they give
		you DC++ 'the only source for all your time pass'.You get literally
		<b>everything</b> from latest movies, games, audio/video tutorials of 
		any kind of learning course. And that too at an average <b>download speed</b> of 20mbps (11 if you use cat5 lan cable), so I suggest you to buy a latest lan cable (cat6). All you need to do is share 64GB of
		data on downloaded DC++ software. Well actually thats not all.<br/>
		Other than these you need to set proxy in your dc too and that is 10.102.38.238 presently (when you set the below settings, click on reconnect and you will know where to put this proxy) and thats it. You can share your data from the sharing tab in settings. 
		So make sure to check out the DC.<br>
		<a href="../DCPlusPlus-0.843.exe" download>Download DC here!!.</a>
		Change your dc settings as followed.
