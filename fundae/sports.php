				OK GUYS!! Now comes the time to get out of your JEE  preparation mode and stretch your limbs. Sports culture of IIT Kgp is one of the best among all the IITs. 
				<br />Here you get ample of opportunities to excel in any sport you like. Remember that life doesn't give opportunities very often but when it does , its your responsibility to grab 'em. So sit tight and try to squeeze max out of what you are getting.
				</p>
			<p>
				<h3 style="margin:1%;">Facilities <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span></h2>
					<?php include('gallery.php')?><br>
				The Heart of all the sports activities at Kgp is the <b>"Technology Student's Gymkhana"</b>
				<br />In Gymkhana, there are 4 Badminton courts , pool table , TT tables , Squash court and Gymnasiums for both student and faculty.Plus we have got Basketball courts, Volleyball courts, Tennis court & Swiming Pool at different locations in the campus.Plus we have 2 ultimate playgrounds. To check their exact location ,please visit our Know ur campus link in the footer.
				<br />Even the Halls also have some courts , gym utilities and sports facilities.Hall also provide you sport equipments to play any sport, you can borrow them from the hall security office.
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
				<h3 style="margin:1%;">Events <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span></h2>
				There are so many sports events going on in the campus 
				around the whole session.You have to practice hard and brush up your skills for participating in these events as every year Kgp get so much talent.
				<br />If you play Badminton or TT or Squash or any other individual game or you are an athlete then <b>Fresher's Events</b> is your deal.Thats the platform for you to show everyone what you have got in your package. They are generally organised in the month of august. They are not only fun to participate in but also your first step towards your dream <b>THE INTER IIT</b>.<br/>
				<br />Next in row comes the <b>Inter Hall Events</b>.They are very much important not only to the hall but to the players also.In these events teams of every hall play against other hall in order to collect points and fight for the cup of <b>The General Championship, Sports (GC)</b>.Tempo of inter-halls is just ultimate. Once you enter the arena you will automatically develop so much sento to your hall which you never felt. Last we ourselves experienced it. <br/><br/>
				This has nothing to do with the topic but I'll still tell u. Last year we sitting in the front rows of the basketball court cheering for LBS in the inter-hall final against MS. Which we won. That was such a time, we were feeling like we ourselves are playing in the court. So we shouted and hooted as hard as possible. And after we won, there was a big scuffle between the two halls, for which we were very much responsible.<br/>Any ways, getting back on track....
				<br/>
				<br />Make it sure that its not everyone's cup of tea to play in GC.You have to attend the practice sessions of that particular game you want to participate in and then team will be selected by seeing the skills and the tempo of the player.
				And not to mention, in Kgp ,<b>Tempo is always prior to skills.</b> The teams selection of individual games are greatly influenced by the Fresher's Events.GC practice sessions usually starts in the starting of the month of January.
				<br /><br/>
				The list doesn't end here. We also have <b>Open IIT</b> events in which any one from the campus can participate regardless of his year or hall.They generally occur a few weeks after coming from the winter break. Even the winter vacations are packed up.Inter IIT's are organised in that time. Inter IIT team is also selected on the basis of Inter IIT practice sessions.
