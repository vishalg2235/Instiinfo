					<h2>CV V/S CG</h2>
					
					<p>Let me give a basic KGP funda, from now on what will matter in your college life and ahead is not your JEE rank but mainly two things: CG and CV. CGPA or CG will reflect your hard work in academics and will tell how in-depth knowledge you have of the course. On the other hand CV will mostly consist of all the co-curricular activities that you will undertake during your stay in the college. <br>

Now comes the bigger question, what should be ones focus on, CG or CV? To be frank about it, CG always has an upper hand. No matter what you do in campus, you can never forget that the main purpose of you coming into IIT is to study, so never during your stay here, ever dare to keep your academics on a lower priority list. You can always pay complete attention on your CG and end up with a fairly good paying job or entering a good college for higher studies, but in the process you will miss the opportunity of exploring yourself and your extra interests. The awesome culture of KGP gives you another option, you can start the first year with an open mind and have a look at the things this place has to offer, take part in events, join societies, hold Position of Responsibilities, play some sport, do things that truly interest you; do anything but waste your time. PORs reflect your leadership skills in your CV. When you join societies or play games, you interact with many people and your confidence is boosted. You won’t get these 4 years back ever in your life, the best years of your life, so don't just waste it... develop an attitude of an IITian. About CG, no one can help you with that other than mugging. Extra academic activities build your CV, during placements companies at times look people who can do other stuff other than excel in their acads. In short build your CV but never at the cost of your CG. 
 <br>

Don’t go by some exceptional stories that you might hear. Remember you are one of a kind and will have a story of your own, be wise while making your choices.

				<br><br><br><b>ALSO HERE'S A NICE SUGGESTION GIVEN BY A GUY ON QUORA...</B><br>
				<br><b>	1. Don`t get into the rat-race for a stud-like CV: <br></b>

Just don`t do that. Dont participate in activities so that you can add them on your CV. I have seen guys who are a part of every second group/club on the campus trying to do everything they can. Placements don`t work that way. The reality is that for you to be eligible to show your CV to the interviewers you have to clear a lot of hurdles 

<br><b>A. CGPA -</b> A lot of companies have CG criteria. So, you will have to have a decent CG. to get shortlisted. Thus, focus on Acads and try to score a stud-like CG. Trust me, your CG never leaves you alone.

<br><b>B. Aptitude Tests -</b> You would be shocked when low profile guys will clear these aptitude tests and bag jobs easily; while you would be cribbing that your profile aptly suited for the job. This goes into saying that you should not underestimate these low profile people who have CGs plus an awesome aptitude.

<br><b>C.Good soft skills:</b> A person who can speak goes a very long way. There is nothing mesmerizing to listen to a good speaker if you are an interviewer. You dont realize it now that the world, sadly, runs on packaging - i.e. what you can present. So practice GDs with your friends or take part in clubs where you can improve your soft skills.

<br>It is after clearing these barriers you get to enter that small room where your recruiter welcomes you. Yes he does welcomes you. They are in your campus to give jobs. They want to take people. So don`t perceive them as ghosts who are going to haunt you. They are very nice people. Talk to them like you would talk to some random person you meet. Let them discover who you are. And trust me they dont have all the time in the world to go through your long CV. They generally stick to one or two things in your CV and grill you on them. 

The calmer you are, the better you fare.

<br><b><br>2. Have a Balanced CV:<br></b>

Your CV should be balanced - Acads, Extra-Curricular, Sports (if possible). What I mean to say is take part into things which you really like. 

For example, I gave interviews, as a fresher, to only one group which really interested me and I went on to became the Team Leader of that group in my third year. The intention never was CV-making; it made itself. So the extra-curricular section of my CV is filled with my work in that particular group. And this speaks for the passion I have for the things I like. So mostly when I am being interviewed it revolves around it and I have good credentials to prove it.

And to some extent, Point 1 (Acads, Apti, Soft Skills) pretty  much wins the race for you. In my campus interview for Deloitte they did not even ask anything from my CV. I did well in the Group Case Study that they promoted me directly to the final round and summed it up real quick with an on-the-spot offer. 

<br><br><b>3. Read:<br></b>

Read newspapers & business magazines because you can farewell in GDs and Soft-skills section. A friend of mine used to read Economic Times and The Hindu a lot (he still does). He had/has interest in Stock markets and all related stuff. And his Flipkart GD topic was "Is Indian economy on right path?" He dazzled everyone with lots of numerical figures and facts which few of the candidates knew.

And reading in general is a very good habit. So, Read

<br><br><b>4. Preparation for specific companies:<br></b>

Everybody has a dream company to join. And some of these dream companies have standard procedures that they have been following on campuses from years. So talk to your seniors to understand that process and start working towards it. A major part of that process would already be covered in the above 3 points but then there are some specific things like - certain kind of case studies, guessestimates etc - that you will also have to prepare for.
