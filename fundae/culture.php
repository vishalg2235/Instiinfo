		<p>
			So now comes the turn of the widest aspect of IIT-KGP, its culture. When you come to IIT KGP & spend some time here, the culture and the way we live our lives here will certainly fascinate you the most. The way you get to live in IIT KGP is the probably the best time you'll ever have in your entire life. In the first few weeks of your stay here, you will probably think that what ever written here is pure shit. Well don't worry, its not because IIT is not good, its because you expect too much from it. Before entering in an IIT one has so many expectations and thinks that IIT would be like some heaven. Yes, it is actually heaven but not like the way you were thinking. The exposure and experience you get in KGP is the most valuable thing. You can't get something like that from anywhere else. Your alma mater gives you so many things, its all up to you whether u accept them or not. <br />
			<br />
			<li><h4>LINGO</h4>First thing in the culture of KGP, which you should know is the KGP LINGO , <b>the language and abbreviations used in KGP.</b>You will get so much used to it, that even in your family n old friends, you will spit out the words like load n peace.You certainly need to go through this awesome feature of your new life.

			<br>
			<li><h4>FESTS</h4>
			Now let's talk about the Fests. Like every IIT, IIT-KGP also celebrates two fests.<br /><b>1. SPRING FEST</b> (the annual Social & Cultural Fest)
			<br /><br />Probably the 3 days of <b>SF</b> will be the best time you spend in 1st year of KGP. <b>SF </b>is the annual social & cultural festival organised in month of Jan. & is one of the largest student run college fests in India. The flagship events of SF are - Nukkad, Shuffle, Wildfire, Rangmanch, Centrifuge, Lake Side Dreams, etc. Besides this there is a Perpz stage which is an all day dance floor with a DJ, that attracts huge crowds. The biggest event in Spring Fest is <b>"STAR-NIGHT"</b> which usually involve live concerts by famous Indian artists like<b> Farhan Live, Salim-Sulaiman, Pritam, Kailash Kher, KK, S. P. Balasubramaniam, Shaan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Vishal-Shekhar, Shweta Pandit, Shankar Mahadevan, Shivamani, Sukhwinder Singh</b>. Bands like<i> Pentagram, Swarathma, Underground Authority, Kryptos, Parikrama, Euphoria, Indian Ocean, Strings , Spunk </i> etc. have also been performing here.
			So many participants and audience comes from different colleges to enjoy SF, their arrival is the favourite thing for the boys, you know what I mean :) . One thing that may be I didn't mention is the ratio of girl:boy here is 1:10. And now you definitely know what I mean :P . There is so much excitement and enthusiasm for the fest even before its commencement. Every single person goes out in the streets, they sing, they dance, they eat & they don't sleep. Nights are spent on scholar's avenue, days are busy with all the events going on. Sometimes one is not even able to decide which events should they attend. You better search on Youtube for SF and watch some documentaries then only you'll get some feel of it. I'm already waiting for the next SF to come. <br><a href="http://springfest.in" target="_blank"

			<br><br>These "FESTS" are completely managed by students of IITKGP. It is a very big responsibility to manage such a big platform fest. Every year students are chosen for these responsibilities, so it would be a great achievement if you are a part of it.
			</li>
			<br>
		<li><h4>GENERAL CHAMPIONSHIP (GC)</h4>
		<center><a><img src="../pics/cup.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			As the name suggest it is the annual inter hall competition between diff. halls in IIT KGP. It has three different fields : Sports, Technology and So-cult(social & culture). Its the time when ur hall tempo will be at its peak. Each and every boarder of that hall takes part in it whether they will be in team or in cheering team. It is the best time to show your talent and dedication. There are so many diff events under GC. Each event has points. Finally the hall with most points in a category gets the trophy of that GC. If a hall wins all 3 GCs then its called<b> "Platinum GC"</b>.
			</li>	
			<br>
		<li><h4>BHAAT MAARNA AND 2.2</h4>
		 <center><a><img src="../pics/2.2.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			These two things are integral part of any Kgpian. 2.2 is just a closed loop road which is commonly used for jogging, talking and time passing... And bhaat maarna is the talking people do while sitting, walking, eating etc etc. Even canteens have a item named as "BHAATU MAGGI" in their menu. So u can understand how much influence our lingo has in our life.
			</li>
			<br>
	    <li><h4>FRESHER'S EVENT</h4>
			Its a very entertaining event organised by team SF at the start of each new session. It includes physical exercise with a lot of enjoyment. And its a small competition in which fucchas participate in groups. So it also includes team work but in a very fascinating way. Its again a great opportunity to improve your friend circles.
			</li>
			<br>
		<li><h4>KHOJ</h4>
		<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXv6zyxMMfI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
			It is a very entertaining treasure hunt type of event organised by 'AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE'. You need a team of 5 to participate in it. There are certain clues out of which different sets of codes are given to different group of teams. Each clue is related to some location in the campus. So your team have to guess the clue nd search for the next one. Top three teams to guess 15 clues are declared winner. So you better start exploring the campus as soon as you arrive here. It will be a memorable event in your life!!!
			</li>
			<br>
		<li><h4>GPL</h4>
			You remember celebrating birthdays with candles lit on your beautiful cake and your family & friends singing for you, right?? Well you better forget all that coz b'days at kgp are going to be really very painful, thanks to GPL.  As the word specifies, everybody kicks the butt of the birthday guy . Even water is arranged, coz kicking on wet and cold butt hurts more. For cooling fire extinguishers are used :p. Even facebook events are created, lyk "kedia ki grand GPL". So, you will know it clearly once u see it.
			</li>
			<br>
		<li><h4>LIBRARY</h4>
		<center><a><img src="../pics/lib.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a></center>
			Hey you must be thinking that library is for studying?? Not in IIT KGP, except for the maggu's !!! Mostly library is used in exam times when its open 24/7 and lots of people stay there whole night long. There are three types of people in library -<br>1. Students who study in groups.<br> 2. Couples-who obviously don't study together.<br> 3. Boys- who come just to have a look at the "crowd".<br> So basically, who only study in the library, are the maggus.
			</li>
			<br>
		<li><h4>DEPT. FESTS</h4>
			<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j36-y7D0M7A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
			Almost every department of the Institute conduct its departmental fest. It will be completely organised by the students of that department. Students from different colleges participates in these fest and increases the honour of IITKGP.

			<br>
		<li><h4>ILLU</h4>
		<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JuHGElbXZjc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
			ILLU is the short form of <b>"ILLUMINATION"</b>. You must have celebrated<b> DIWALI</b> by firing crackers, eating sweets, or maybe never celebrated it. But you could never have imagined that it can be celebrated with a feeling of <b><i>"teamwork"</i></b>! Yes, I'm not kidding you would have never seen anything like this, from weeks before the DIWALI the various halls starts making a huge structure made of 'diyas' which are lit on day of diwali. One by one these diyas are lit and slowly the "structure" starts taking its shape and delivers everyone what people were working so hard for. Even rangolis are made by various halls. I had never seen such amazing rangolis, its like they use <b><i>"technology"</i></b> in making rangolis!!! I can't express in words the essence of diwali, the level of art shown and the tempo people have for it. You will never regret that you didn't get any holidays even on diwali.
